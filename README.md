Graceful degradation and service workers are related in that service workers enable web applications to function reliably without network connectivity. Graceful degradation refers to the design strategy where an application still offers basic functionality when advanced features fail or are unsupported. Service workers support this concept by providing offline capabilities, caching assets, and intercepting network requests, allowing the application to “degrade gracefully” rather than break entirely when a user is offline or experiences poor connectivity.
